# Expenses Tracker App

* My first React App, inspired from an Udemy React Course.

* Project that tracks your monthly expenses, filter the expenses by year and shows to the user a dynamic chart based on the information provided.

* Uses the concepts of: components; outputting dynamic data; passing data via "props"; "useState" hook; listening to user input; form submission; rendering lists of data; adding dynamic styles.
